# Todo
ReactJs + Django 


Project Contains:-
* This is a small TodoList project consisting of the Event of Todo task along with the Date added and Date of submission of the task, Where I had used ReactJs as FrontEnd and Django as BackEnd.
* Django maintains the List of Objects as models, added as Todo via Django Administration, and the list is shared to the ReactJs server via RestFrameWork of Django.
* ReactJs renders the list by fetching it from Django, using an effective API fetching method i.e using Axios.
* Used Bootstrap to increase designability, and some SVG files.

Running:-
* Run the ReactJs app using npm start 
* In additional run the manage.py runserver in virtualenv.
